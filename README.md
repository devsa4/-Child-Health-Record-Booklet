In many rural, underdeveloped, and disaster-affected regions, millions of children
suffer from malnutrition. To combat this, UNICEF, in partnership with local
governments, dispatches health workers and volunteers to remote areas—places
where internet access is unreliable or nonexistent.
These field representatives must collect critical health data: children’s
demographics, nutrition indicators like visible symptoms of malnutrition, recent
illness history, and parental consent. Often, this data must be gathered completely
offline and stored locally until the representatives reach an area with internet
connectivity. At that point, the representatives must authenticate using their
national ID via eSignet (OTP-based verification) and upload the stored data
securely.
